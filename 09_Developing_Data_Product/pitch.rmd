## Introduction

We all have concerns our bank accounts. Do they charge too much comparing to others.
What are the best products to invest in or does the product have high yield rate. 

A web application is here to answer all your questions at once with informative 
and esthetical graphs as well as interactive search panel catering to your tastes

This web app is developped using the popular data analysis language R and its 
web development package Shiny.
